Question 3's explanation:

a.) We first notice that client_fragment.c only checks for a '/' sign to terminate searching CN index.
That means we can use openssl req to create a new CSR such that '/.neocal.info' is appended after the original CN.
With the new CSR, we then ask Budget Certs R Us to sign it.
We also notice that client_fragment.c uses both memcpy and strcpy.
Moreover, we know that if we add '\0' to the end of an CN, it would be seen as exactly the same.
With this in mind, we ask Budget Certs R Us to sign a new CSR where '\0' is added instead of the '/'.
We then modify the rewriter.py so that we can see the secret as well as the 'emergency_kill' parameter.
By changing 'false' to 'true&' in rewriter.py, we not only preserve the length of the request but also force the software to terminate.
Running 4thwall.neocal.info verifies this.

b.) For MITM attack like this, there is nothing the server can do to prevent this.

c.) The Governor should perhaps stop using buggy code. He should either fix the bugs/vulnerabilities in his code or use well-tested libraries.

d.) The CA can look for suspicious domain name that's a potential attack. It should perhaps verify the domain name before signing a CSR.
