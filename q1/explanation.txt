a) I basically used wireshark to sniff packets. I opened q2a.pcap after following the preferences given in the specs, and I saw the decrypted traffic. I found the plaintext and that's how I got the secret.

b) RSA - used for authentication + key exchanging
   SHA-384 - hash function in pseudo random functions
   AES-256 - confidentiality and integrity

c) Key exchanging, such as DH, could have been used. If leaked, it would maintain the confidentiality before it got leaked.
