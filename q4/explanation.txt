a) Basically this uses a DNS spoofing attack. Basically target the domain, and then create a fake DNS response record and create a DNS packet containing the original query and a response, and send this guy. Then, since the Gov. still trusts DigiPwntar, even though we compromised it, generate a new CSR and then a certificate. Then start the local webserver and run pcap_tool.py simultaneously, and he will type in his password (which we will get to see). 

b)He could protect himself. For example certification pinning would work, as even though the CA is compromised if Gov. pinned a specific cert then any cert that isn't the original would arouse suspicion. Even one that's correctly signed.
